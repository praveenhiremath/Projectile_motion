# Computational Physics course at Lund University: The projectile problems dealt here are of a cannon and a baseball 

We are familiar with the solution of a projectile problem when air resistance, altitude, spin of the body (in this project cannon and baseball) and wind speed are not accounted for. 
However, these factors cannot be neglected if we are interested in the study of more realistic projectile motion. The aim of this project is to consider these factors, particularly air
resistance, altitude and spin of the body to simulate the trajectory of the projectile motion. As the ordinary differential equation (ODE) associated with this problem is not easy to
solve analytically, a numerical approximation is implemented here.
